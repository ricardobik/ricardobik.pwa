## Tutorial Project

This progressive web app was built for the sole purpose of:

* [Introduction to Progressive Web Apps - Part 1](https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-progressive-apps-part-one)
* [Introduction to Progressive Web Apps - Part 2](https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-progressive-web-apps-instant-loading-part-2)

**Note:** You can learn from the codebase, but it's not advisable to just copy and paste everything into production because there are lots of edge cases that I didn't handle.
